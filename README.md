**Toy models of superposition.** Reproducing toy models of superposition: how a network stores more features than it has dimensions.

**Status:** not started.

## Question

How does a network store more features than it has dimensions?

## Plan

- **Architecture:** x → ReLU(WᵀWx + b), with n features (5–20) squeezed into m dimensions (2–5), varying feature sparsity and importance.

## Experiments

- Reproduce the phase diagram of superposition versus sparsity.
- Plot W's columns in 2D to see the polygons.
- Measure each feature's dimensionality.

## Done when

The general checklist:

Apply this checklist with the project-specific requirements and exceptions in
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#project-specific-scope).

- `just quick` runs end to end on CPU in under 5 minutes, as a smoke test.
- The full run fits on one consumer GPU (8–12 GB VRAM) and auto-detects cuda, mps or cpu.
- Each run saves weights, `metrics.json` and its plots to `runs/<run-name>/`.
- This README shows the headline result with plots, compares against baselines, and states negative results plainly.
- Tests cover data generators, tensor shapes and one tiny overfit check.

## Notes

- Trains in seconds on CPU. Good for fast iteration on plotting.

## Quickstart

Needs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and [just](https://just.systems/). Everything else, Python 3.12 included, comes from uv.

```sh
just setup              # uv sync, then install the pre-commit hooks
just quick              # CPU smoke test, under 5 minutes
just train              # full run; flags pass through, e.g. --run-name wd1.0-seed0
just analyze <run>      # baselines, probes, interventions and plots
just test               # pytest
just check              # ruff and basedpyright, as in CI
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (gitignored) for `HF_TOKEN` and `HF_USER`.
